Box Model will allow you to define an elementary proabability space: labeled tickets are placed in a box and shuffled, and some number of tickets are drawn - either with or without replacement between draws. ProbabilitySpace allows you to create custom spaces more complex than modeled by a box model. Lastly, to draw from multiple indepdent random variables we can use the operators * and **. \n",
